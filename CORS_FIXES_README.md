# CORS Issues Fixed - Crypto Portfolio Application

## üö® Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Primary CORS Issue - Port Mismatch**
**Problem:** Backend API was configured to run on port 5123, but frontend expected it on port 5000.

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `CryptoPortfolio.API/Properties/launchSettings.json` to use port 5000
- Standardized all configurations to use port 5000

### 2. **CORS Policy Configuration**
**Problem:** CORS policy was too restrictive and didn't support multiple environments.

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced CORS configuration in `Program.cs` with separate policies for development and production
- Added support for multiple origins including localhost variations
- Added credentials support and proper headers configuration

### 3. **Middleware Order Issue**
**Problem:** GlobalExceptionMiddleware was registered after other middleware, causing issues.

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved GlobalExceptionMiddleware to be the first middleware in the pipeline
- Added proper middleware ordering with detailed comments

### 4. **Docker Configuration Issues**
**Problem:** Docker compose had incorrect frontend build path and inconsistent port configurations.

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed frontend build context path from `./frontend` to `./CryptoPortfolio.WEB/crypto-portfolio-frontend`
- Updated Docker environment variables for proper container communication

   - Changed port from 5123 to 5000 for consistency

3. **`CryptoPortfolio.API/appsettings.Development.json`**
   - Added AllowedOrigins configuration for production CORS policy

4. **`CryptoPortfolio.API/Controllers/HealthController.cs`** (NEW)
   - Added health check and CORS testing endpoints
   - Provides debugging information for troubleshooting

### Frontend Changes:

   - Enhanced error handling for CORS and network issues
   - Added specific CORS error detection and user-friendly messages
   - Added health check API methods

2. **`CryptoPortfolio.WEB/crypto-portfolio-frontend/src/components/debug/ApiDebugPanel.tsx`** (NEW)
   - Created debugging component for testing API connectivity
   - Provides real-time CORS and connection testing

3. **`CryptoPortfolio.WEB/crypto-portfolio-frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`**
   - Integrated debug panel for development mode
   - Shows debug panel when API errors occur

### Docker Changes:
1. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - Fixed frontend build context path
   - Updated environment variables for container communication

## üß™ How to Test the Fixes

### 1. **Development Environment Testing**

#### Start the Backend:
```bash
cd CryptoPortfolio.API
dotnet run
```
The API should now start on `http://localhost:5000`

#### Start the Frontend:
```bash
cd CryptoPortfolio.WEB/crypto-portfolio-frontend
npm start
```
The React app will start on `http://localhost:3000`

#### Test API Connectivity:
1. Open the React app in your browser
2. If there are any API connection issues, the debug panel will automatically appear
3. Use the "Test Ping" and "Full API Test" buttons to diagnose connectivity

#### Manual Health Check:
- Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` directly in your browser
- Visit `http://localhost:5000/api/health/cors-test` to test CORS specifically

### 2. **Docker Environment Testing**

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# The services will be available at:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
# - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
```

### 3. **CORS Testing Checklist**

‚úÖ **Backend starts on port 5000**
‚úÖ **Frontend can make GET requests to `/api/health`**
‚úÖ **Frontend can make GET requests to `/api/portfolio/dashboard`**
‚úÖ **Frontend can make POST requests to `/api/portfolio/transactions`**
‚úÖ **No CORS errors in browser console**
‚úÖ **Debug panel shows successful connectivity tests**

## üîç Debugging Tools Added

### 1. **Health Check Endpoints**
- `GET /health` - Basic health check with environment info
- `GET /api/health` - API health check with detailed request info
- `GET /api/health/cors-test` - Specific CORS testing endpoint

### 2. **Enhanced Logging**
- Request/response logging in the backend
- Detailed CORS error messages in frontend
- Origin tracking for debugging

### 3. **Debug Panel Component**
- Automatically appears in development mode when API errors occur
- Provides real-time connectivity testing
- Shows detailed error information and suggestions

## üöÄ Additional Improvements Made

### 1. **Error Handling**
- Better error messages for CORS issues
- User-friendly error descriptions
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 2. **Configuration Management**
- Environment-specific CORS policies
- Consistent port usage across all environments
- Proper Docker networking configuration

### 3. **Development Experience**
- Debug panel for easy troubleshooting
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

## üîß Configuration Summary

### Development Environment:
- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:5000`
- **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **CORS Policy:** Allows localhost origins with credentials

### Docker Environment:
- **Backend API:** `http://localhost:5000` (mapped from container port 80)
- **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Internal Communication:** `http://api:80/api` (container-to-container)

## üìù Notes

1. **Port Consistency:** All configurations now use port 5000 for the API
2. **CORS Flexibility:** Development mode allows multiple localhost origins
3. **Error Recovery:** Debug tools help identify and resolve connectivity issues
4. **Docker Ready:** Fixed paths and networking for containerized deployment

The CORS errors should now be completely resolved, and the application should work seamlessly in both development and Docker environments.
